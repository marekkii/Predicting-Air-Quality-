# Predicting Air Quality in the Netherlands using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models
This repository contains the code and data for my master thesis in the field of Data Science & Society. The focus of this thesis is to predict air quality in Utrecht, the Netherlands by examining machine learning and deep learning models.

# Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python (3.9 or greater) installed on your machine. Additionally, the following libraries are required:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Usage
To reproduce the plots and analysis presented in the thesis, you can run the provided notebook. However, please note that depending on your local computer setup, you may need to modify the file paths in the notebook/flat-file to match the location of the datasets.

# Data
For this thesis, I utilized two open-source datasets: the RIVM air quality data and the KNMI weather data. These datasets serve as the foundation for training and evaluating the models. The RIVM air quality data provides information on PM<sub>2.5</sub>, while the KNMI weather data offers weather-related features that influence air quality.

# Contributing
As this repository is primarily dedicated to a master thesis project, contributions in the form of code changes or additional features are not expected.
