# Predicting Air Quality in Utrecht, the Netherlands, using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models
This repository contains the code, plots and data for my master thesis in the field of Data Science & Society. The focus of this thesis is to predict air quality in Utrecht, the Netherlands by examining machine learning and deep learning models. This research compares the state-of-the-art LSTM model to a recently developed Transformer model and a linear regression model

# Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python (3.9 or greater) installed on your machine. Additionally, the following libraries are required:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Usage
To reproduce the plots and analysis presented in the thesis, there are 2 options:
<br>
1. <b>Notebook:</b> Run the provided notebook. The notebook contains both code and explanatory markdown text, making it easier to follow along with the analysis. However, please note that depending on your local computer setup, you may need to modify the file paths in the notebook to match the location of the datasets and other resources. <br>
2. <b>Flat Python file:</b> Alternatively, you can run the flat Python file provided in the repository. This file contains the full code without the markdown text. It is recommended to refer to the notebook for clarity and understanding, but if you prefer running the code directly, the Python file is available for that purpose as well. Again, please ensure that you modify the file paths if necessary.

# Data
For this thesis, I utilized two open-source datasets: the RIVM air quality data and the KNMI weather data. These datasets serve as the foundation for training and evaluating the models. The RIVM air quality data provides information on PM<sub>2.5</sub>, while the KNMI weather data offers weather-related features that influence air quality.
